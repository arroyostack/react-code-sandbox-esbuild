# JavaScript Code Compiler and Executor

A web-based application capable of compiling, transpiling, building, and executing JavaScript code. It allows users to import libraries from the npm registry, including React. The app utilizes Esbuild-wasm for these tasks directly in the browser environment.

## Features

- Compile and transpile JavaScript code.
- Build and execute code in the browser.
- Import libraries from the npm registry, including React.
- Uses Esbuild-wasm for efficient code processing.

## Credits

The original idea for the plugin used in this project is from Stephen Grider, a outstanding software developer, and code mentor. The plugin addresses the challenge of not having a file system in the browser when using Esbuild-wasm.

## Beta Version

This is a beta version with basic functionality. Further features and improvements will be added to this repository. Developers are encouraged to try the app, provide feedback, and report any bugs.
